## Introduction

The Campus Viewer App originates from a group bachelor project I worked on in 2013-2014 with my team "The 10tastics".

In this project, models of our [Fulda University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-fulda.de/en/home) were remodeled with Google Sketchup and inserted into HTML with the 3D framework [X3DOM](https://www.x3dom.org/) from Fraunhofer IGD.

## Purpose

The goal of this app was to develop a simple orientation guide for students when seeking specific rooms of their courses at the university. They could view class schedules and comment on rooms.

The user moves through the campus of the Fulda University of Applied Science in a first-person perspective using a control cross. 

The first-person perspective can be rotated using drag and drop on the screen.

A building can be entered by clicking on the door or by selecting it in the navigation system.

## Responsibility

I was responsible for the backend part and developed the phpMyAdmin SQL database and implemented the functions for registering, logging in and commenting. The programming language used was JavaScript (including Node.js and jQuery). The database is located in the path `Campus-Viewer/Campus-Viewer2-master/prototype/server`. The index file is located in the `Campus-Viewer/Campus-Viewer2-master/prototype/client` directory.

## Future

The main server where the app was uploaded no longer exists. The source data for the Campus Viewer app is available as an open source project. The code is no longer up-to-date, which is why the app cannot be loaded properly. The project is no longer being worked on and only serves as a portfolio. 

## Notes

The project itself, some files, folders and comment lines are in German. This app has not been tested for 5 years. The source codes of the Campus Viewer app are in need of improvement due to teething problems.
The Campus Viewer App is outdated and serves only as portfolio.
